A QR Code Scanner application is a mobile utility that allows users to scan and read QR codes using the device’s camera. It quickly decodes the information stored in the QR code, such as website URLs, text, contact details, payment links, or app download links.

The application provides fast and accurate scanning, often with features like automatic detection, history of scanned codes, and secure link preview, making it useful for payments, information sharing, and quick access to digital content.
